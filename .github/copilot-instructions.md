This is a php based project. php 8.3 is the minimum version required to run this project. 
php 8.4 features are not used in this project. codeception is used for testing.

## Key Guidelines
 - Do not modify `composer.json` or `composer.lock` files, if requried only for testing and do not commit changes to these files.
 - Do not modify `codeception.yml` or creat it, if requried only for testing and do not commit changes to these file.

## Code Standards

 - Use symfony coding standards. 
 - Follow PER Coding Style 3.0 see https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/
 - Use single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed. 
 - Use `===` for comparisons and avoid using `==` unless necessary.
 - Make new classes final unless they are intended to be extended. 
 - Dont add '@param' to methods unless the parameter type is not clear from the method signature.
 - Dont add '@return' to methods unless the return type is not clear from the method signature.
 - Follow the principle of least surprise, meaning that code should be easy to understand and follow common conventions.
 - Follow the principle of return early, meaning that if a function can return early, it should do so to avoid deep nesting.
 - Use dependency injection for classes and services. 
 - Avoid using static methods and properties unless absolutely necessary.
 - Use contructor injection for dependencies. Avoid using global state and singletons.
 - Use constructer promotion for class properties.
 - Follow the principle of minimal visibility, meaning that class properties and methods should be as private as possible.
 - Use interfaces for classes that are intended to be used as services. 
 - Avoid using abstract classes unless absolutely necessary.
 - Add a `@throws` annotation to methods that can throw exceptions, and document the exceptions that can be thrown.
 - Add a new line at the end of each file. Use UTF-8 encoding for files.
 - Use `null` coalescing operator (`??`) for default values when applicable. 
 - Use `match` expressions for simple value comparisons.
 - Use `array_map`, `array_filter`, and `array_reduce` for array transformations instead of loops when applicable.

## Repository Structure

 - Use the `lib/` directory for application code.
 - Use the `models/` directory for application code.
 - Use the `bundles/` directory for application code.
 - Use the `tests/Unit` directory for unit tests.
 - Use the `config/` directory for configuration files.
 - Use the `vendor/` directory for third-party dependencies managed by Composer.
 - Use the `doc/` directory for documentation files.

## Testing

 - Use Codeception for testing.
 - Follow the Codeception documentation for writing tests.
 - Write unit tests for new functionality. Use mocks and stubs where applicable.
 - Use `codeception.dist.yml` for Codeception configuration.
 - Run tests using `vendor/bin/codecept run` command.

## Documentation

 - Use `@deprecated` annotation for deprecated methods or classes.
 - Use `@example` annotation for providing examples of usage.
 - Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
 - Suggest changes to the `doc/` folder when appropriate
