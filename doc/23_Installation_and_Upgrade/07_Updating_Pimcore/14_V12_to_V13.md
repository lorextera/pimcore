# Upgrading Pimcore from Version 12.x to Version 13

## System Requirements

### Symfony 7.3+ Required

Pimcore 13 requires **Symfony 7.3 or higher**. All Symfony 6.x components are no longer supported.

**Before upgrading:**

1. Update all Symfony components to version 7.3 or higher
2. Test your application thoroughly with Symfony 7.x
3. Remove any explicit Symfony 6.x version constraints from your `composer.json`

## Breaking Changes in Version 13

### Symfony Templating Component Removed

The `Symfony\Component\Templating\EngineInterface` and related services have been completely removed.

**What's Removed:**

-   `pimcore.templating.engine.delegating` service
-   `Symfony\Component\Templating\EngineInterface` support
-   `Pimcore\Templating\TwigDefaultDelegatingEngine` class

**Action Required:**
Update your code to use `Twig\Environment` directly instead of `EngineInterface`.


### QuantityValue Formatting Changes

-   The space between QuantityValue value and unit is going to be removed. Please make sure any custom code that relies on the space is updated accordingly.
