# Upgrading Pimcore from Version 12.x to Version 13

## Tasks to Do Prior the Update

### Symfony 7.3+ Required

Pimcore 13 requires **Symfony 7.3 or higher**. All Symfony 6.x components are no longer supported.

1. Update all Symfony components to version 7.3 or higher
2. Test your application thoroughly with Symfony 7.x
3. Remove any explicit Symfony 6.x version constraints from your `composer.json`

### Migrate Folder structure for email logs
The folder structure for email logs has changed to YYYY/MM/DD/\<log filename\>. 
Please execute the command `pimcore:migrate:mail-logs-folder-structure` to move the files into the new folder structure or move the files manually.


## Breaking Changes in Version 13

### Symfony Templating Component Removed

The `Symfony\Component\Templating\EngineInterface` and related services have been completely removed.

**What's Removed:**

-   `pimcore.templating.engine.delegating` service
-   `Symfony\Component\Templating\EngineInterface` support
-   `Pimcore\Templating\TwigDefaultDelegatingEngine` class

**Action Required:**
Update your code to use `Twig\Environment` directly instead of `EngineInterface`.

### QuantityValue Formatting Changes

-   The space between QuantityValue value and unit is going to be removed. Please make sure any custom code that relies on the space is updated accordingly.
